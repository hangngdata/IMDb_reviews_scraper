2,Wicked,2024/11/22,WICKED IS A MASTERPIECE!!!,popcultureqveen,2024/11/19,10,"WOW!!! This film exceeded my expectations. Can we talk about how BLOWN AWAY I was by both Ariana and Cynthia's performances, and honestly the entire cast!

Ariana wasn't kidding when she said she put her entire heart and soul into preparing for the role of Glinda. This is a dream come true for her, and I couldn't think of anyone else for this role.

Cynthia's belting was out of this world. She stepped into the role of Elphaba with ease.

The singing was LIVE mind you.... including the stunts.

I will be watching a million times in theaters (and hopefully soon on digital) in anticipation for Part 2!",358,465
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Best movie of 2024!!!,darvindw,2024/11/19,10,This movie is by far one of the best movies of all time. The director is a genius and the actors did an amazong job!!! Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo are not only able to showcase big emotions but also are in a superior league when it comes to vocal performance. Arianas powerful vocals combined with extrodinary vocal control are able to get you to tears as well as the power and pureness of Cynthia Erivos voice. Both of them as well as the other actors are able to push you to tears but also get you to joy. Especially Grande has a great sense of humor and is going to make you laugh throughout the movie!,154,290
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"NO JUST NO, NOT NEEDED",magiciancolin,2024/11/19,2,"This film's cinematography and sets is the only thing going for it. The story isn't anything new from the musical. The costuming is ugly, the acting is okay and Ariana Grande is at least trying to do anything with what she is given. There is nothing here and once again we have an over hyped dumpster fire the will probably be given award nominations because it's catering towards that. If you're a fan of films that are remakes, then this if the film for you. Fans of the musical. Then this is not the film for you and should stick the the musical and avoid the film as it'll ruin the musical for you. I still don't know how they will make a sequel. That's DEFINITELY NOT NEEDED.",105,176
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,a masterpiece,agustiniluis,2024/11/19,10,"Cinema is back on! 'Wicked' casts a spellbinding charm on the big screen! Director John M. Chu masterfully adapts Gregory Maguire's beloved novel and the stage show, bringing Oz's iconic witches to life. Cynthia Erivo shines as Elphaba, complexity and depth radiating from every note. Ariana Grande dazzles as Glinda, comedic timing and vulnerability perfectly balanced. Their chemistry ignites a poignant exploration of friendship, prejudice, and self-discovery. A must-see musical spectacle for the whole family, probably the biggest movie of the year and a big award contender. Could it give movies like 'Titanic' and 'Return of the King' a run for their money??",88,188
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"Wow! Epic, stunning, genius movie musical!",mdebard,2024/11/19,10,"Advance screening of the new movie Wicked (part1): Wow! Spectacular, creative, wonderful dancing and singing and sets. Almost like old MGM massive musical movies from the '60's with CGI. I loved the brief cameo of Kristen Chenowith and Idina Menzel singing with Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. The latter two leads have great chemistry together with wonderful voices and acting. A sweeping 2.5 hour epic that justifies its two parts. Incredible costumes. Michelle Yeoh is wonderful as Madam Morrible. Some changes from the musical are both necessary and wonderful additions to the movie. Make sure to see it when it opens this weekend!",76,174
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,AMAZING,hensleylaney,2024/11/19,10,"Powerful performances, most moving movie I've seen in years! Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande had breathtaking performances. A wonderful mix of humor and deep connection and emotions. I'm not a musical theater person but I was wonderfully surprised! Jonathan Bailey brings such a charm and lovable nature to Fiyero. The whole cast was phenomenal and it's the most moving film I've seen in years! I will definitely be watching this over and over again. All of the songs were so very pleasant. The sequences to the those scenes are amazing. It was all just... amazing. Something that I think most everyone will be able to connect with.",176,277
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Insane,cvusd-49522,2024/11/19,10,"This movie has left me speechless. For starters, I've never been too excited for a movie, ever. Yet the trailers for Wicked built up so much hype to the point where I couldn't wait to watch it. Unfortunately though, the trailers were nothing compared to the marvel that is the movie itself. The vocals, the choreography, the stunts, everything was just incredible. Knowing that everything was sung live really immerses you into the movie. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo each play their role flawlessly, and it is easy to tell how much effort, time, and determination they put in. My suggestion? Immediately go to your nearest cinema and experience this fantastic movie adaptation yourself. I will 100% be watching part 2.",60,146
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Talk about Defying Expectations!,chammouth,2024/11/19,10,"As a theatre kid and long-time lover of The Wizard of Oz and Wicked, I had high hopes for this film and prayed it would be all that and so much more. And that it was!

The performances, especially by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, are Oscar-worthy. We see a whole new side to their insane talents and what they're truly capable of doing. Throughout the film, I had forgotten that it was Ariana as Glinda, because I saw her fully embody this role in the way that she said she would. She is HYSTERICAL and the whole theater couldn't stop giggling. Cynthia is an absolute powerhouse that left me left speechless after each star-studded performance. Having followed her journey for a while now, it came at no surprise the amazing beauty and strength she gave Elphaba. Together, they were radiating power, friendship and emotion.

The chemistry of the entire cast was lively and formed an environment that felt ethereal, along with the groundbreaking visuals of the settings! Wow. Just wow. It was beyond believable, and felt as if I was there, immersed in this world of Oz the entire film. And no, the trailers do not do this film justice and they don't spoil ANYTHING!

The musical numbers were traveling throughout my heart and soul, and it was an out of body experience that I will never forget.

This deserved two parts, and I see EXACTLY why it was split up. Yes, the film is long, BUT there is never a dull moment that arises. Each scene, each exchange is filled with its own magic.

Ariana, Cynthia, Jonathan, Jeff, Michelle, Ethan, Marissa, and the entire cast truly put their own unique twist on the songs, on the characters, all while paying homage to the original and to the Broadway show.

To Jon, this is what real cinema is. The camerawork and directing was something I had never seen carved. You have shattered the bar and allowed for more creativity to flow through and take over. Transcending time, going above and beyond the status quo and bringing us into the story. You absolutely nailed it and left no room for error. You truly defied gravity.

Bravo!",210,300
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"Stunning, made me feel like a kid at the movies again",jjoshuagregory,2024/11/19,10,"I went to see this because my girlfriend is a Wicked fanatic. I've seen OB productions (and I like them) but I'm not a particular fan.

I was expecting to enjoy this film despite myself, but I was blown away. The movie ended and, even after two hours, I was sad it was over. The visuals, practical effects, blocking, dancing, acting and singing were breathtaking.

This is the best movie adaptation of a musical I have ever seen.

The film allowed more moments of delicate acting which allowed me to feel the connection between the characters more than I did seeing off broadway productions of Wicked.

You are missing out on one of the best moviegoing experiences of the decade if you don't see this in a theater.

It was not perfect. I think Jeff Goldblum was a tonal choice, but his brief singing was a bit out of place. Michelle Yeoh was a great choice but her singing was solid.

Highly recommend!",47,118
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Gaygasms galore!!!!,traviswilson-86615,2024/11/19,10,"WOAH!!!!!!!! As a Wicked the musical fanatic this PERFECT movie exceeded every expectation and hope I had. Cynthia and Ariana are pure magic. Laughed, cried, cheered, jumped out off my seat, and was beyond enthralled with the many many plot additions from the book and phenomenal cast and talent. John Chu's choices on arrangements and shots were spot on and made everything so interesting and like the musical version on steroids. The numerous cinematic nods to the original Wizard of Oz, silluhettes, props, cameos, and Easter eggs were so much fun and brought pure joy to those who love those universe.",11,29
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,FLAT visually and narrative wise,rhaynes1974,2024/11/19,3,"Saw the South African premiere last night and was utterly gobsmacked how Universal took a fantastic stage property that I saw on both Broadway and the West End and created such a flat, bland, colourless digital mess.

The vocals by Grande were well executed but the songs just didn't have the energy you feel with a live on stage performance. The script was dragged out, cliche ridden and quite frankly needed some really tight scissors to get things moving - this does not hold for its bloated 2 hour and 40 minute runtime at all.

This talk of Oscar nominations baffles me but maybe I'm just not the target market for this one when The Substance with Demi Moore was my favourite film of the year so far.

C'mon Hollywood make something engaging again and maybe take some notes from Richard 'O Brien of Rocky Horror fame when it comes to adapting stage to screen.

I'm sure I'll be in the minority with this film that felt it was bland and flat but it's an opinion nontheless.",241,211
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Defeated Gravity!,danielggarza,2024/11/19,10,"If you have seen the stage production and have questions, the movie version will answer them. I saw it on IMAX, and the surround sound added to the experience. If you follow the negative stories that came out before and after the movie wrapped, watching the film made me forget all about them.

Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande made the characters their own, and the changes in the musical arrangements brought a fresh new take. The visuals were amazing. If you are a fan, this might make you a super fan!

If there is anything negative I can say is I wish it was all one movie, but the part I & II was genius!",23,75
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,First time I've ever clapped at the end of a movie,lopesfyi,2024/11/19,10,"I find clapping at the end of a movie extremely cringy, but this one DESERVED IT. Absolutely INCREDIBLE movie! Made me cry, smile, and laugh all in under three hours. It's funny because right off the first 30 minutes you'll immediately know it's going to be a great movie. Everyone's acting was ON POINT! The effects, the story, the dances, music, it's not secret why everyone at the movie theater pre-screening was blown away.

Can we talk about Ariana's acting? Cynthia's too... the two were perfect for each other. I want to watch this movie again and again and again. 100% recommended. Thank you for this amazing movie.",25,80
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Amazing.,ypvhqhpb,2024/11/19,10,"This movie is clearly one of the best movies this year. It brings so much joy, sadness and inspiration where two girls best together. If you have got a chance to watch it , do it cause you will be changed for good. I really think it is better than most people imagine. And please Ariana's performance??! So good. I don't know why people were scared and doubting her. And ofc cynthia, !!!! This movie is strong in so many aspects just like the original book. Recommend, Recommend. It is really a reminder that it is okay to be different or feel different. You are never alone and this movie might be for most of us people.",37,93
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Phenomenal,yohannesasfawmulugeta,2024/11/19,10,"I don't know much about the musical, but I'm familiar with the classic Judy Garland version, The Wizard of Oz. The world-building in this film is the best since Harry Potter and delivers everything you'd want from a fantasy experience. It looks, sounds, and feels exactly as a great fantasy movie should. Ariana Grande brings her own unique personality to Glinda, blending charm with a playful, modern energy that feels fresh and exciting. Cynthia Erivo delivers a powerful and heartfelt performance as Elphaba, infusing the character with raw emotion and a profound sense of strength. Their on-screen chemistry makes every scene between them unforgettable, elevating the story's magic and emotional depth. Can't wait for part two!",443,362
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"Strongest Movie Musical Since ""Hairspray"".",CamMattox,2024/11/19,10,"This star studded cast somehow took these already difficult songs and performances, and expanded upon them. Cynthia and Ariana's ability to opt-up on many of these fifth octave songs was insane. My theatre burst into applause after every musical number. Cynthia's ability to convey emotion, while simultaneously invoking it from the audience, showed me why she's nearly achieved EGOT status. ""The Wizard and I"", Ozdust Ballroom, and ""Defying Gravity"" are perfect examples of this, and left my theatre floored! Ariana Grande-Butera is THEE heart and soul of this film. I know going into this, most people had their doubts with her casting. Ariana completely puts those comments to rest. Her comedic timing had audience members in tears, rolling out of their seats. The subtle change in her voice inflictions gave her Glinda an entirely new personality. Her coloratura soprano completely soared through the entire movie. In fact, I'd say that Ariana is most likely to get award buzz from this than any other member of the cast. The film even took actors that aren't as known for their singing, (Jonathan, Jeff, and Michelle), and somehow made their songs extremely likable.

I'm still on a Wicked rush right now, and can't really formulate all my feelings. But, what I can say is that Wicked is undoubtedly in the ""Top Movie of 2024"" conversation. I see Wicked Part 1 being a very strong award vehicle going into Oscar season. If you were having doubts about this movie, you are wrong. Go see this film, (as I have bought 3 more tickets for this week!).",40,103
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Pop-u-lar,BBBerry00,2024/11/19,10,"Wicked (2024) is truly a masterclass for so many aspects when making a movie. John Chu made this his own, while still sticking close to the original material. The acting by the whole cast makes you really feel like they are living these stories in Oz. The vocal choices, especially by Erivo and Grande, are enough to make it feel special, without being overdone. The choreography done throughout every number was well thought out, and everything feels like it flows very well, gliding to the next move. Lastly, the cinematography, which is the reason I think this movie deserved to be made. It goes beyond what is possible for the stage, with sweeping shots, close-ups, and beautiful set designs showing the pop-ifying colors of Oz. The movie took its time in order show the emotions needed for this story. With this being just act one, they are able to show more of each character, and why they do what they do. Don't run, fly, to see Wicked: Part One!",31,88
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,A masterful stage to film masterpiece,AlMiBui,2024/11/19,10,"Absolutely magical. 10 out of 10. I'm honestly floored by the performance of everyone involved from the big names to the dancers in each piece down to the art done by the crew. The production is full of heart and you can tell from the final product that they left no stone unturned with how they could transform this iconic stage musical into a film musical.

The audience is given the chance to see up close the immersive world built on the foundation laid out by the original stage musical and the original film through the intricately crafted practical sets and vibrant colors.

Hands down one of the best musicals I have seen in theaters.",28,86
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,One of the best modern musical adaptations,UnbiasedAnonymous,2024/11/19,8,"I had the pleasure of seeing the Broadway production of Wicked in New York back in 2008. Whilst I had my complaints (specifically around the second act), there was no denying that the music and sets created something magical that I am happy to say Jon Chu has managed to capture with this film.

Both Erivo and Grande give enchantingly memorable performances as the leads. It was clear both actresses took the time to think about how these characters should transition from stage to film without feeling silly or misrepresented. The supporting characters also all gave strong performances and fit their roles well.

The production design, costumes, and makeup in this film are all excellent. It does a great job of transporting you to the land of Oz.

The musical numbers were never not entertaining, with an energy that allowed the choreography and set pieces to shine, as well as the performances.

This film is only half of the story and ends the same way as Act 1 from the original musical. Similar to Dune, I feel this was poorly advertised, and may leave some people feeling mislead or unsatisfied.

The CGI in the film is used sparingly (mostly for the animals), but at times did feel distracting.

Overall this was one of the best musicals I have seen in a very long time, and I am excited to see what they do with part 2.",146,212
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,From skeptical to stunned,keshamcclurehunley,2024/11/19,10,"Hollywood often takes adaptations and halfway creates them to just be a means to an end of gathering the money of a fan base. This didn't happen with Wicked. The film was handled with care and a keen eye. It holds extremely close to the stage play with its own movie magic flair. Even though I don't prefer some of the cast members otherwise, they were perfectly cast and played their characters with all of their being. This movie is movie musical perfection from the sets to all of the visuals to the vocals and music arrangement. The colors were as vivid as the emotions portrayed. The only thing disappointing is the wait for the second half.",41,99
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Meh,mlhare,2024/11/19,3,I had high hopes for thie movie. I love the wizard of oz and have never seen this show in theatre so figured i could go in fresh. Many people i have spoke to said it didnt compare to the theatre version. Although i really dont like ariana grande i was so pumped to see this movie so i decided to anyways. I wish i did not. It was way overdone. Maybe it is for the younger generation and i just dont get it. Now i dont know if i will ever watch the wizard of oz again either. No actor truly stood out. The singing wasn't anything special and the movie itself was bloated. I will not be waiting for or watching part 2. Honestly i think like me many will want to see this but then realize there ie no way they are going to watch a second one. They will need to make the money off this one while no one is the wiser.,170,151
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,beautiful wickedness,ferguson-6,2024/11/19,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Who is the good witch and who is the bad one? For those of us whose obsession with the classic 1939 film version of L Frank Baum's 1900 novel has lasted from childhood through adulthood, it has always been crystal clear that the Wicked Witch of the West was bad and Glinda the Good Witch was so-named for obvious reasons. Then along came Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel ""Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West"", and the subsequent 20+ year Broadway run of the stage musical, which generated many new fans. And now we have a film adaptation of the stage production is directed by the talented Jon M Chu (CRAZY RICH ASIANS, 2018) with a screenplay co-written by Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021) and Winnie Holzman (who wrote the musical book for the stage musical). Could it be that the line between good and evil is not so clear? Or even that others have manipulated the situation to ensure a villain exists? I'm so excited for Oz fans to watch this.

Cynthia Erivo stars as Elphaba Thropp, the misunderstood, green-skinned outcast, and Ariana Grande Butera co-stars as Galinda/Glinda Upland, the rich, spoiled, popular kid. These two Grammy winners both deliver incredible performances with singing voices that leave us in awe. Ariana hits notes that seem otherworldly and Erivo is truly dynamic. It's staggering to think much of their singing was performed ""live"" while acting. There is no way I'm going to spoil any of this, especially for those who have not seen the stage musical. Director Chu opted to keep the characters and songs from the musical, while adding even more detail to this film version.

Whether you prefer to label this a prequel or origin story, you should know going in that the complete story has been divided into two movies. The second part will be released in November 2025. This part one opens with Glinda gliding into Munchkinland to confirm the latest big news. She's then persuaded to tell the backstory, which we watch in flashback form. We see the cutest ever newborn baby with green skin, and witness how Elphaba is mistreated in her own home in favor of her wheelchair bound sister Nessarose (Marissa Bode), to whom their father demands she offer protection as they head off to Shiz University in the Land of Oz.

Judging her strictly by her 'different' appearance, everyone's favorite classmate, Galinda, immediately treats Elphaba as a misfit, leading others to do the same. When Madam Morrible (Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden powers in Elphaba, she arranges for the two rivals to share a dorm suite. This initially causes the rift to grow, right up until things thaw and a friendship forms. During some of these scenes, Ms. Grande flashes true comedic timing with giggles, patented hair flips, and some real zingers embedded in her self-serving compliments. Along the way, Fiyero Tigelaar (Jonathan Bailey, ""Bridgerton""), a charming and carefree Prince, crosses paths with the girls, creating conflicting emotions.

Of course, this is a musical, and the familiar songs are not only sung beautifully, but most feature some intricate choreography and acting as well. Erivo and Grande each get their standout numbers with ""Defying Gravity"" and ""Popular"", respectively. We see Elphaba turn to activism and a quest for kindness and justice in a sequence involving Dr. Dillabond (voiced by Peter Dinklage), one of the last remaining teaching animals at Shiz. The tone shifts quickly once Elphaba and (now) Glinda head to Emerald City to meet the Wizard, played by a surprisingly reserved Jeff Goldblum. We are also struck by Elphaba's quiet dignity on her path to transforming into her more famous role.

There are countless life lessons to be taken from this fantastical world filled with colorful characters, and it's interesting to see political strategy play out in a way to create the villain we are told is necessary to unite Oz's citizenry behind the cause. We are also reminded that there are two sides to every story, and even Glinda realizes this as she and her new friend come to a fork in the road - or a broom on the balcony - that will determine their future. It's quite a journey for these two, and along the way we see the fabulous Oz train, the Wizard's for-show mechanics, the Grimmerie (Elphaba's magic book), and of course, the fabulous flying monkeys (responsible for so many nightmares since 1939). We even get appearances from Kristen Chenowith and Idina Menzel from the original stage production.

The film looks absolutely marvelous, and much of that is thanks to the incredible sets created for the film ... so much better than the heavy dose of green screen effects we've become accustomed to. Production Designer Nathan Crowley deserves mention, as does Paul Tazewell for the brilliant costume designs. The music is courtesy of John Powell and Stephen Schwartz (songs from the musical), and the choreography is from Christopher Scott. Oscar winner Frances Hannon delivers superb Hair and Makeup, while Director of Photography Alice Brooks and Visual Effects Director Pablo Helma give the film its remarkable look. We may have to wait a year for Part 2, where hopefully we discover how Glinda becomes sincerely good, but there's little doubt this first part is memorable and worthy of multiple viewings.

Opens wide on November 22, 2024.",35,90
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,A Magical Masterpiece,thereelauthority,2024/11/19,0,"To my surprise, ""Wicked"" was my most anticipated film of the year. Sure, movies like ""Deadpool & Wolverine,"" ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,"" and ""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice"" held my curiosity and cautious optimism, and I had the same feelings toward ""Wicked"" at first. However, the fantastic trailers won me over to the point where every time they played before another film, I couldn't help but get excited. I've never seen the original Broadway show, but the Judy Garland-starring ""The Wizard of Oz"" is my childhood. I even saw its dark yet enchanting unofficial sequel ""Return to Oz"" and Sam Raimi's Tim Burton-esque ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" in preparation for this. The hype is real, so I would be upset if it fell flat - but it didn't! The film fan and critic in me loved ""Wicked,"" and I'd like to talk about why.

The acting and singing were stellar around the board. Cynthia Erivo was spectacular as Elphaba, the titular Wicked Witch of the West. Erivo brought gravitas when portraying the human side of the famous villain, especially considering this film is her origin story. I also can't forget Ariana Grande as Glinda. Musicians have always had trouble transitioning into acting, with Eminem's performance in ""8 Mile"" almost always in the conversation of artists who succeeded. I've seen Grande in other films before, and her role in ""Hairspray Live!"" was entertaining, but these performances haven't proven her as a professional. ""Wicked"" changes that, as this interpretation of Glinda seemed to have Grande in mind from the start, and it's better because of it. The rest of the cast performed skillfully, with other standouts being Peter Dinklage as Dr. Dillamond and Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar. Bailey steals the show, as Tigelaar is an incredibly whimsical and hilarious supporting character who may win you over.

I have to give proper recognition to Director Jon M. Chu. He directed this hugely ambitious, large-scale tentpole like a pro, and I respect him for accomplishing this possibly wearying task.

Even though studios nowadays try to hide that these movies are musicals, the trailers didn't entirely cover it up. As a musical, it was outstanding. See ""Joker: Folie à Deux,"" this is how you do a musical! All the songs and ensuing musical sequences were extraordinary, with ""The Wizard And I,"" ""Popular,"" and ""Defying Gravity"" being the highlights for me. The songs are paired with impeccable choreography, costume, and set designs from Christopher Scott, Paul Tazewell, and Nathan Crowley.

The CGI was unbelievable, bringing many elements, including the animals, to stunning life. It enhances the magic feel of this film, and the fact the movie cost $145M overall and had exceptional visuals is jaw-dropping. Speaking of which, I'm sorry, ""Mega-flop-olis,"" though I still think your visuals are mind-blowing, ""Wicked"" has taken your title as the most impressive film visually this year. It goes without saying that ""Red One"" spending $250M might have resulted in great visuals, but how they spent less here is more commendable.

Regarding the narrative, it wonderfully flips the original Wizard of Oz story on its head. Again, this is the story of how the Wicked Witch of the West came to be. There is a sense that the gleeful characters we knew from the original may have helped the Wicked Witch become her namesake.

Additionally, I laughed many times. In particular, Erivo, Bailey, and Grande's characters have hilarious exchanges that made the entire theater I was in laugh, and I couldn't help being part of that crowd. Dana Fox and Winnie Holzman deserve credit for having a remarkable screenplay.

Finally, the runtime was surprisingly well-utilized. Before going into detail, I must mention why I had cautious optimism about this film before the trailers. There are two reasons: this was part one of two, and it runs at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I was unsure if this film would drag or have any unnecessary scenes. After seeing it, I am pleased to report I wasn't bored or upset with any of the scenes or pacing decisions. Very few films have this runtime and utilize it flawlessly.

In conclusion, I fell in love with ""Wicked,"" and it is difficult for me not to. In a year with incredible films, ""Wicked"" manages to stand above most of the rest and is one I feel has a strong chance of winning the Oscar for Best Picture.

Technically, the performances from actors like Erivo and Grande, the breathtaking visuals, M. Chu's magnificent direction, the script, and the pacing add to a 10/10 masterpiece.

For the enjoyment score, we rarely see a film outside of animated features that appeal to all audiences. I believe that younger and older audiences alike will love this absolute treasure. The enjoyment score is a well-deserved 10/10! If this is one of the year's best films, ""Gladiator II"" has a long way to go to be the victor of ""Glicked."" This musical is a must-watch in theaters, and I can't wait for ""Wicked Part Two""!",79,148
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Way more than I expected,sousa-71649,2024/11/19,10,"Wicked has always been one of my favorite musicals, and I must admit I was initially skeptical about how it would translate to the big screen. However, I was completely blown away. The movie is an emotional rollercoaster, so intense and beautifully interconnected that I was literally trembling after watching it.

Cynthia Erivo is a force of nature. Her voice is pure magic-powerful, genuine, and deeply moving. Every note feels alive, and her ability to convey emotions with just her eyes is absolutely mesmerizing. Ariana Grande, on the other hand, was a delightful surprise! She brought so much humor, humanity, and charm to her role, showing layers of vulnerability I didn't expect.

Jonathan as Fiyero is magnetic-his presence on screen is captivating, and his charisma shines in every scene. And let's not forget the ensemble! Their performances were nothing short of phenomenal. Each member brought an energy and depth that elevated every musical number, creating moments that felt larger than life.

The live singing added another dimension of authenticity, making every note resonate with raw power. You can feel the emotions bleeding through the vocals, giving the film an unparalleled intensity. The production design is also worth praising-every detail, from the vibrant costumes to the jaw-dropping sets, reflects the heart and soul of the original stage production while reimagining it for the big screen.

Though the runtime might seem long at first, time absolutely flies. The pacing is flawless, and every scene feels purposeful, building towards an unforgettable finale. This movie is not just a film; it's a cinematic experience, a masterpiece that does justice to the magic of the stage.",26,75
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,I already want to watch it again. And again.,qccgkfb,2024/11/19,10,"I saw an early screening and Wicked was just as good as I thought it would be. You can tell how much everyone involved in making it truly loves and respects the original musical, book, and the original Wizard of Oz film. There were a couple of tiny lines from the musical that weren't in the film, but none of them were dealbreakers. On the whole they stayed true to the musical and expanded it in masterful ways. I expect they'll be winning so many awards for acting, set design, costumes, music, makeup... It was so well done all I want to do is go back to the theatre and watch it again and again.",33,82
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Hollywood finally got one right (almost),disneymomtotwins,2024/11/20,10,"Having seen Wicked on Broadway with the OBC, various tours, and most recently the 20th anniversary broadway performance, as well as loving every Stephen Schwartz musical from Godspell & Pippin to more obscure ones (Working, Children of Eden) to other favorites (bakers wife ) to his Disney film scores (pocahontas, hunchback) and Kerner animations (prince of Egypt) - he has been my favorite composer for over½ a century. I read Gregory Macguire book, so my husband got me tickets to the new musical- how lucky am i? He even lives in the next town over!

I also love all kinds of musicals- unfortunately Hollywood doesn't have a great track record in filming and showcasing them. The list of disappointments far outweigh the successes. Hunchback & POE were turned into great performance musicals. I'm deeply and thankfully relieved & happy that THEY GOT WICKED RIGHT. SO SO RIGHT. I won't post spoilers but keep an eye on the guard in the window at the end of one fine day. And the licensing issues that kept the stage show from even using a pink dress have Obviously been settled. The homages to the orginal book, original film and Gregory macguies book are many&awesome (as well as more accurate) the only downside is this is only the first half of the story we have to wait a year to see the rest.

Ensemble was great and the set was real which was refreshing from the prevalence of CGI nowadays. WOWOWOWOWOW. The comedic timing of Ariana was exquisite. The heart of Cynthia had people in tears and I will be seeing this movie again as soon as possible. I grew up on Wicked and it's always nerve wracking when there are adaptations of things so sacred like Wicked. Jon M. Chu did NOT disappoint, and Ariana absolutely took such good care of Glinda. Also...I'm obsessed with Jonathon Bailey.",5,19
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Wicked Bad and not in a good way,silversonna,2024/11/20,2,"I don't know a lot about the musical so I can't say whether this is a badly done version or not, however I can say it's completely inferior to the original Wizard of Oz by a wide wide wide margin.

Firstly the acting simply isn't up to par from both leads. Ariana Grande is especially dead eyed and just doesn't cut it at all. But perhaps she'll be big with the tik tok crowd despite her obvious lack of ability. Second the songs are flat and lifeless and mostly forgettable. There is also a weird quality to the film and it tells flat and lifeless.

Whatever is planned for part two - this film definitely didn't need two parts and is just a drag.

Having said all this if you enjoy 5 second reels on social media and are a fan of bland pop then this is probably for you. So while this will be popular, it's one of those things that in a few decades people will say ""who liked this junk?"" about.",90,89
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Wow!,anasztaziyawan,2024/11/20,10,"I hardly bother with writing these, but Wicked truly deserves a shout-out. From the opening scene to the final note, the movie is a spellbinding spectacle that brings the beloved musical to life in the most enchanting way. The casting is spot on, with each actor breathing fresh energy into their roles while staying true to the original characters. The visuals are stunning, seamlessly blending whimsical set designs with breathtaking special effects that transport you to Oz.

The music, of course, is a showstopper-classic songs reimagined beautifully while keeping their emotional impact intact. The chemistry between the leads, particularly in their evolving friendship, is heartfelt and adds depth to the story. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the musical or entirely new to the tale, Wicked is a magical experience that leaves you humming long after the credits roll. Don't miss it!",48,115

Everything from the production to the vocals to the acting is amazing. Ariana grande is sooo funny and her vocals are literally out of this world. Cynthia Erico is spectacular. Her acting is absolute perfection and her voice is just gorgeous. The trailers don't do the colours justice. The movie is so colourful and ""alive"". You feel every emotion that is possible to feel while watching this movie. I cried 100 times. It's just absolutely spectacular I'm usually not a fan of musicals but this one changes my mind. The songs definitely add something instead of just being there for no reason and they are all so good. I definitely recommend watching, it's just amazing.",18,57

With every line delivered and every movement made, they embodied their characters flawlessly, right down to the smallest mannerisms. Erivo's powerful vocals and emotionally charged portrayal, paired with Grande's captivating presence and vulnerability, created a dynamic on-screen chemistry that resonated throughout the entire film.

But it wasn't just Erivo and Grande who shined in this movie. The supporting cast brought their A-game as well, each actor seamlessly blending into their roles and adding depth to the story. From the opening scene, the audience was immediately drawn in by the gripping performances and intricate storytelling. Every detail, from the costumes to the set design, worked together to create a visually stunning and emotionally resonant cinematic experience. It was clear from the first opening scene that this movie was going to be something truly special.

Wicked brings a strings of emotions from giggles, teary eyes, and multiple feel good/heartfelt moments. This film is whimsical! Vibrant colors, adorable animals, and a fantastic wardrobe choice. Ariana Grande especially blew me away from the very beginning with the song ""No One Mourns the Wicked."" You can tell she worked tirelessly on her vocals and acting for this role.

As I walked out the theater, I found myself humming the songs (At times without even noticing). I couldn't stop thinking about this film even days later. I quoted several iconic lines. I realized then, I have truly been ""Galindafied.""",6,23

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,A Spellbinding Journey Through Magic and Melody,pinkmanboy,2024/11/20,10,"Jon M. Chu once again proves his undeniable talent for creating cinematic spectacles that are both visually stunning and emotionally captivating with ""Wicked."" This adaptation of the iconic Broadway musical spares no effort in transporting audiences to the enchanted land of Oz. Every detail, from the vibrant streets of Munchkinland to the opulent halls of the Emerald City, overflows with imagination and technical precision. The sets not only emulate the grandeur of the stage production but also expand the universe with an epic scale, while the lavish costumes add layers of personality to each character and setting. Meanwhile, the cinematography amplifies the immersion, using vibrant colors and evocative lighting to highlight both the magic and the melancholy moments.

One of the film's greatest triumphs lies in its musical performances, delivered with infectious energy and meticulous choreography. Numbers like Dancing Through Life blend music, dance, and scenery to create moments that capture the essence of the stage show while embracing the fluidity cinema allows. Chu's dynamic camera work skillfully highlights the dancers' movements without sacrificing scale or clarity. However, it's in more intimate scenes, like Popular, where the film truly shines-balancing humor, emotion, and visual spectacle to craft a feast for both the eyes and the heart.

At the center of this extravaganza are Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, whose performances bring Elphaba and Glinda to life in ways that honor the characters' legacy while adding their own nuances. Erivo captures Elphaba's vulnerability in a breathtaking way, conveying her struggle against rejection and prejudice with a depth that transcends the script. Her powerful voice pairs perfectly with her magnetic stage presence, keeping audiences glued to her every move. Grande, on the other hand, surprises by taking Glinda beyond the expected superficiality, exploring the insecurities and contradictions of her character. Together, they build a relationship that is both humorous and deeply moving, especially in quieter moments like the silent dance that solidifies their unlikely friendship.

""Wicked"" excels in weaving heavy themes like oppression, authoritarianism, and discrimination into a narrative brimming with magic and fantasy. Chu boldly brings these issues to the forefront, enriching the story with a contemporary relevance that resonates with today's audiences. These elements provide a fascinating contrast to Oz's charming tone, inviting reflection without undermining the whimsical atmosphere. Chu's approach skillfully balances social critique and magical storytelling, adding depth to the world while amplifying the story's emotional reach and maintaining its timeless appeal.

The supporting cast also adds significant value to the film's rich tapestry. Jonathan Bailey exudes charisma as Fiyero, balancing levity and charm in his performance. Michelle Yeoh is commanding as Madame Morrible, radiating a mix of maternal warmth and chilling authority, while Jeff Goldblum clearly enjoys himself as the Wizard, injecting a dose of sinister humor into the role. Peter Dinklage, meanwhile, delivers a poignant performance as Doctor Dillamond, whose journey encapsulates the fight against marginalization that runs throughout the film. These secondary characters help expand the narrative, adding texture to the world Chu so carefully constructs.

""Wicked"" is a cinematic experience that demands to be seen, especially for fans of the original material. The film shines in both its intimate moments and its grand visual scale. With passionate performances, impeccable technical direction, and a world overflowing with fantasy, ""Wicked"" lays a solid foundation for the highly anticipated second chapter arriving in 2025. The promise of an epic conclusion, where themes and storylines will come together more intensely, keeps the magic alive in this adaptation, which manages to dazzle in every carefully crafted detail.",13,42

The two leads, Ariana Grande & Cynthia Erivo are the heart of this film. Both deliver a heartfelt, memorable performance. I especially had my doubts about Ariana's casting at first, as I only knew her about the pop star. She has blown me away with her comedy and amazing vocals. She also really managed to bring forth the vulnerability of Glinda. Cynthia was already an established powerhouse in my eyes and this is by far her best work yet. The rest of the cast also all delivered.",8,37
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,A CGI fuelled mess,bobbymartini-869-473471,2024/11/20,1,"Where to start.....

Wicked is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Winnie Holzman. It is a loose adaptation of the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, which in turn is based on L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its 1939 film adaptation. The musical is told from the perspective of two witches, Elphaba and Galinda, before and after Dorothy's arrival in Oz. The story explores the complex friendship between Elphaba (who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (who becomes Glinda the Good). Their relationship is tested by their contrasting personalities, conflicting viewpoints, shared love interest, reactions to the corrupt rule of the Wonderful Wizard, and ultimately, Elphaba's tragic fall.

That's the plot. Stick with that because this film is a con.....because it's only the first half of the story. It's not called Wicked Part 1 but, trust me that's all you're getting because the film makers are deceiving you - too cowardly to tell you the truth. You've got to wait another year for part 2.....but don't bother....you'll thank me later.

As for the performances - Well, Ariana Grande doesn't look like herself due to the amount of plastic surgery she's had. This results in her looking like an AI creation wandering about the screen.

As for Cynthia Erivo - well, we all know how insecure she is thanks to her complete overreaction of the fan made poster recently. She is completely mis cast in this movie. A competent singer- yes. Over actor - definitely. Her vocal range is incredible but her acting range is limited. They should have cast somebody else.

Song wise - there's a reason you only ever hear is the song Defying Gravity....it's the only decent song in the musical. The rest are forgettable, boring dirge.

Jeff Goldblum is fine but not even his talent can save this mess.

I'll never get those 2 hours back !!!!

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"This is not a cinema, this is something else...",codecode,2024/11/20,3,"If you are primarily interested in movies without being a fan of the original Wicked musical or this particular IP, I would take these somewhat strangely overwhelming positive reactions with a grain of salt. It's nice to see people enthusiastic about big Hollywood extravaganza but this is far, far, very far away from a masterpiece which is so forcefully implied by many major media outlets. First of all, this being Part 1 with a running time of 160 minutes while the whole original musical was shorter than that, tells you enough about the intentions and corporate machinery behind this project.

The positive side besides perhaps 2-3 musical numbers being fun and charming are the performances from Cynthia Orivo and Ariana Grande. They have nice chemistry together and they are obviously great singers. Jonathan Bailey also has fun screen presence and I definitely wanted to see a bit more of him. Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum aren't doing that much here, typical paycheck gigs, no more and no less.

Story is fine, I guess. It has super basic messages about acceptance, being true to yourself, standing up and, and... really basic stuff without any ambiguity to it. However, the pacing is atrocious, film dragged at times and an obnoxiously pedestrian editing didn't help at all. After some time, I simply wanted it to end - again, this is Part 1, so spoilers - it won't end until November 2025.

And how are the visuals? This is one of the worst looking big studio movies I have seen in a very long time - think Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland mixed with MCU's bland colour grading and horrendous lighting that makes everything artificial, soulless and flat. It's astonishing how even the prettiest practical sets can be demolished with post-production in wrong hands. This is a movie where visual components are crucial, it should create that cinematic and magical sense of wonder - remember beautiful Technicolour vibrancy in 1939s Wizard of Oz? Well, that's replaced with the ugliest colour palette you can find in modern film.

Wicked (Part 1!) will be a hit, it's tailored to be, forced into being the ultimate crowd pleaser but the fact that such an unimaginative and borderline lazy and toothless filmmaking is so highly praised, called even a MASTERPIECE, that's the reason why mainstream film industry isn't about art, creativity or originality anymore, it's almost exclusively about corporations creating marketing juggernauts and pleasing the target audience with the safest and the most basic content without the ounce of artistic instincts that are usually needed to mold motion pictures into art. Just like Sir Scorsese once commented on these huge riskless crowd-pleasing corporate events, this is not a cinema, this is something else.",450,300
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,I'd give it 0 stars if I could.,jmack4455,2024/11/20,1,Didn't like this one. The cgi lens gives the whole film a cheap look and I don't like how they didn't manage to make anything look realistic in the film. I thought Ariana grande acting was sub par and Cynthia was as usual not a very talented actress. This movie felt like a high school theater act and not a Hollywood film. I also didn't like the music...it felt very cheaply done. The wardrobe choices were also very odd as they look like something out of a cartoon. Really didn't like this one and I think Hollywood can do better but they choose not to. Instead they keep pushing narratives that aren't important to the film or story being told. I want my money back. 0/10.,134,208

I knew it would be good but it far exceeded all of my expectations. The casting, set design, costumes, cinematography, world building and score were all absolutely breathtaking! As a Broadway baby myself, I would consider this to be one of the best musical adaptations of a Broadway show that I have ever seen! The musical numbers were spot on! Cynthia and Ariana absolutely lost themselves in these roles. You don't see they typical Cynthia and Ari, you see Elphaba and Galinda. The way they absolutely honored these classic roles but made them their own was spectacular. As for the run time, 2 hrs and 41 minutes seemed to fly by in a flash and left me wanting more! Also, the comedic timing of Ariana and Bowen Yang are spot on - no surprises there!

Too often in film adaptations of musicals we lose the spirit of the stage show and the opposite is true here. It is clear that there was immense care in the entire creative process from costumes and sets to the performances themselves. Ariana Grande is hilarious and so genuine as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo was grounded and honest as Elphaba. The film is long but flew by for me. The numbers I most enjoyed were What is This Feeling, Popular, and Defying Gravity!

I was scared the movie wouldn't fully capture the magic of the stage production, but I'm so glad that's not the case. It stays true to the original story while expanding on the scenes and characters and the casting is absolutely perfect. Cynthia is the perfect headstrong and sensitive Elphaba, and Ariana is the most ridiculous bubbly Glinda. The chemistry between these two is absolutely undeniable. Jonathan Bailey has chemistry with every single character he interacts with in this film and I couldn't have asked for a better Fiyero. There were stellar performances from every single supporting character as well. At first, I didn't understand the need for two parts, but after seeing the film, I wouldn't want it any other way.

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING,kevtorres-53693,2024/11/20,10,"I love this film, it's brilliant on its own! Wicked masterfully brings the beloved Broadway musical to life with breathtaking visuals, heartfelt storytelling, and iconic songs that resonate deeply. The way it reimagines the world of Oz from an entirely fresh perspective is both clever and emotionally impactful.

Galinda absolutely ATE-her portrayal is equal parts hilarious, endearing, and commanding. Her journey from a bubbly and somewhat self-absorbed personality to a figure of genuine compassion is beautifully conveyed. The comedic timing, the energy, and the way she owns every moment on screen are simply unforgettable.

The dynamic between Elphaba and Galinda is the heart of the film. Their relationship evolves from rivalry to one of the most touching friendships seen on screen, with incredible performances from the actresses who bring these roles to life. The themes of identity, acceptance, and standing up for what's right feel timeless and universal.

The production design deserves its own round of applause-every set piece is dazzling, from the emerald streets of Oz to the towering halls of Shiz University. Paired with the phenomenal score, each scene feels like a piece of art.

Whether you're a die-hard fan of the musical or a newcomer to the Wicked universe, this adaptation is a triumph that will leave you spellbound. A must-watch for lovers of fantasy, music, and powerful storytelling.",7,30
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"""Wicked"": A Film Oozing With Talent That Indeed Defies Gravity",jaysonpajaronvistal,2024/11/20,9,"""Wicked"" brings to life the untold tale of the witches from Oz, featuring the incredibly talented Cynthia Erivo, known for her award-winning performances in ""Harriet"" and Broadway's ""The Color Purple,"" taking on the role of Elphaba--a young woman with distinctive green skin, often misunderstood, who is on a journey to discover her true potential. The Grammy-winning pop star Ariana Grande-Butera, played Glinda, a young woman who is both popular and ambitious, yet still searching for her true self. As students at Shiz University in the magical Land of Oz, the two form an unlikely but profound bond. However, after an encounter with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, their friendship is tested, leading them down separate paths.

As a theater kid, not by talent but by heart, I am no stranger to the magic of musicals and the transformative experiences that they offer. ""Wicked,"" directed by Jon Chu, is the cinematic equivalent of the Marvel Universe for a theater kid like me. It's a beautiful world where the fantastical meets the profound, and the stage I once adored has now been expanded into a vibrant, larger-than-life universe. As someone who has held the world of Shiz and Oz close to my heart, Jon's adaptation is a grand-scale and beautifully crafted musical, an utterly flawless adaptation of the source material. Jon did not just make the ""Wicked"" world into this grandeur reality; he showed courage by creating his own vision of this already familiar world by adding more emotions and flair to the narrative and not entirely changing the story. It was a conscious decision that showed his respect and care for the source material. The film possesses a heart and vision that transcends and, indeed, defies gravity.

Ariana Grande-Butera and Cynthia Erivo took center stage as Glinda and Elphaba, and their performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Their chemistry is palpable, much like what we usually see in their press conference and interviews, capturing the beauty and complexity of their friendship that is the anchor of the film. The live singing and orchestration add another layer of magic to the film, creating an immersive experience that envelops the audience in the music. The score is grand and evocative, enhancing every emotional beat and elevating the narrative. For fans of the musical, like I am, these elements are a testament to the passion and talent of the entire creative team, who have succeeded in translating the essence of the stage production to the big screen.

As someone who has been following Ariana Grande since her days on ""Victorious,"" I was genuinely surprised by her transformation as Glinda. This was not the pop star I'd come to know; instead, Ariana embraced her inner child and portrayed her role with sincerity and depth that was both unexpected and delightful. Her portrayal of Glinda is nuanced and layered, and you can see her channeling the young Ariana, who watched the musical when she was just 10 years old. Her naivety and childlike performance have captured the true essence of Glinda, a witch longing for popularity and validation from the people around her, and Madame Morrible, played by the Academy-Award winner Michelle Yeoh.

Cynthia Erivo, on the other hand, delivered an Oscar-worthy performance that is both powerful and poignant. Her rendition of ""Defying Gravity"" is a standout moment in the film, echoing with emotional intensity and vocal prowess. It's a performance that pays homage to the iconic legacy of ""Adele Dazeem,"" known as Idina Menzel, while also carving out her own unique version. Cynthia's Elphaba is complex, vulnerable, and very humane, a portrayal that resonates deeply with anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. Is she worthy of an Oscar nomination? Definitely.

As this is just the first part of a two-part adaptation, ""Wicked"" has set the stage for a continuation that promises to be equally compelling and moving. This film is a flawless adaptation, a celebration of talent and vision that showcases the incredible work of the cast and crew. From the visionary director to the outstanding performances from the leads down to the technical brilliance of the production team and music score, ""Wicked"" is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of musicals.

In conclusion, ""Wicked"" is a triumphant film that expands the world of Oz and Shiz's universe in thrilling new ways. Whether you're a longtime fan of the stage musical or new to its enchanting tale, this film captured the essence of what makes the world of Wicked so special and unique-with its exploration of friendship, identity, and the courage to defy gravity. Chu's ""Wicked"" is a cinematic masterpiece that honors its roots while daring to soar to new heights, leaving audiences with a sense of awe and excitement for Part 2.

""Wicked"" will forever be famous-well, Popular! (You see what I did there?)",8,26
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Strange casting,halinoordeen-52967,2024/11/20,1,I don't understand why you would go to the trouble of taking on such an iconic and well loved story like the wizard of oz and then casting the two main characters with unknown actors . I understand ariana is a famous singer but she has no known acting repertoire or background whatsoever. Never heard of or seen the actor playing elphaba before either. You need some powerful actors to make these characters work. Atleast the last Oz spinoff had Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis who are great actors and could really pull these roles off. Without these two main roles being cast well the film is undoubtedly going to struggle! Special effects can only take you so far.,102,199

Cynthia Erivo invokes an emotional response that only she can create. Her acting and her voice are two of the most stunning qualities I've ever heard or seen.

I cry a lot in the whole movie, it's absolutely the movie of the year, Cynthia as Elphaba it's Incredible and Ariana Grande WAS BORN TO BE GALINDA, she makes everyone laugh at the movie, I feel that I was in Oz in all movie, so grateful to see this movie and I will back to the theater to see it again, The Wizard and I scene makes me cry a lot, Cynthia's voice and her expressions was so incredible, natural and beautiful and Ariana singing No Mourns the Wicked was like an Angel I live for this! And Defying Gravity Scene, WHAT A INCREDIBLE SCENE, MAKES EVERYONE CRY AND SCREAM. They Definitely deserves the Oscar's!",5,26
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Wickedly performed!,kpgrodriguez,2024/11/21,10,"This film incredibly exceeded any and all expectations I had, what with Ariana, a popstar, being casted for such a coveted and loved role in musical theater's history. However, she and her co-star Cynthia Erivo just did everything so right and so good! There weren't anything major that I did not like, only certain directory choices that I think would've been more turthful to the stage version. But what Jon M Chu did was more than any other director, fan, or critic could or would've done. They shared the most interesting and most amazing story that not only made the characters seem more real, but also likeable!",6,24
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Cynthia Erivo was BEYOND incredible.,iwatchfilmz,2024/11/21,10,"There have been pink and green promotions for almost a year. All this marketing in stores, billboards, even my Roku was advertising for this movie. All these interviews, all the amazing fashions at premieres all over the world...it seems like a lot for yet another play-turned-movie.

My friends, hear me with your hearts: it was not enough.

I promise you, on my life and the lives of every member of my family, this movie was incredible.

I say that with no hyperbole at all. People throw around words like stunning and fantastic and the things they are describing are usually mediocre at best.

Every single part of this movie was spectacular.

There were a million things to see in every scene.

No slow parts.

All of the actors SHOWED UP! Literally everybody.

But Cynthia Erivo...my God. The acting, the singing, the whole vibe....an almost 3 hour buildup to that final number, and it was everything you hoped it would be.

The guy next to me cried. Everyone on my row held a breath that we didn't even realize we were holding until the credits rolled and we all simultaneously exhaled.

When people talk about movie magic, THIS is the film they are referring to.

You MUST go see it. You simply must.",6,25
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Best film of the year so far,wills-50922,2024/11/21,10,"I just finished watching wicked. I saw the broadway show once several years ago and even though I knew what was going to happen, I was thoroughly entertained and the ending was a huge wow. I see multiple award nominations in this films future. Adapted screenplay , costume, set design, director, best picture. Cynthia is incredible. Ariana was a surprise. She really embodied Glinda without being a copy of previous actresses portrayals. They both should be in consideration for acting awards. The direction was masterful. To coordinate all the dance sequences and action sequences so seamlessly really shows the skill the director has. I'm seeing this again with family.",8,26

The 3D enhanced the beauty of this masterpiece.. the character chemistry is unbelievable. I would love to see this movie win multiple awards. A few surprises added to the fun. Ariana Grande is a far better actress and singer than people give her credit for and Cynthia Erivo, WOW! Speechless of her talent and beauty. I enjoyed the elements that struck a chord with how we treat others.. humans and animals in this current climate. It may not be for everyone, but I think everyone should give it a chance. Treat others the way you want to be treated💚",8,25
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"Popular, this film is going to be popular",ymrhqtrz,2024/11/21,10,"Having seen the wicked production on west end, I had high expectations for this film and boy were they met. The acting was phenomenal, the music, the cinematography everything was just amazing to watch. Ariana and Cynthia were absolutely phenomenal and deserve the Oscar buzz. I saw someone from South Africa review the film and stated that they were confused, don't be confused, watch the film again ;). The chemistry between the two main actresses was undeniable, factor into it that they have amazing vocals and it's a match made in heaven. Was the run time a bit too much? Maybe! But I had so much fun watching the film that I barely noticed the run time. All in all this is one of the best films of 2024 and best musical adaptation I've seen in a very long time. I would highly recommend anyone who is a theatre kid or musical enthusiast to go and watch this masterpiece of a film.",17,44
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Flawlessly Executed,djudernatz,2024/11/21,10,"For those giving 1 star, let me just say that this is an adaptation of the musical, not the novel (which I have read). This is also supposed to take place in a magical and fanciful world, not somewhere here in the real world.

Now, having seen Wicked on tour, I have to say this movie did it justice. The singing was awesome (apart from Michelle Yeoh, who did the character itself justice, but the singing reminded me of Pierce Brosnan in Mama Mia), the choreography was fantastic, and the cinematography was excellent. Yes, CGI was used, but it was well done and used appropriately. It was also great to see the original duo get a cameo. And, as always, Jeff Goldblum was stupendous. This movie did not disappoint and I'm looking forward to Part 2. But why do we have to wait a year!!!??? It's too long!",10,27

It literally got goosebumps from hearing Cynthia Erivo sing ""The Wizard & I"".

Ariana Grande's performance made me teary eyed hearing & seeing her rendition of Glinda. You could see her emotion in defying gravity & no one mourns the wicked. She's also a comedian!

Jonathan Bailey was incredibly raw, & absolutely stunning. A marvel! Dancing through life was his moment to shine and that he did! I am looking forward to his duet with Erivo in part 2 next year. Bravo!",11,33

Apart from the fact I don't think Wicked has the best story line, the movie made the best out of it, in my sincere opinion. Direction is great!

I didn't know they would split it in two, so I was expecting the whole story in this movie, but I think it is better this way, because they can explore all the story, the development of the characters etc.

Art direction is a 10/10. Singing also perfect. Watch it, you won't regret it!",140,202

Wicked should be up for awards especially for set design, acting and directing are all great aspects. I'm generally not a fan of musicals but glad I saw this wild ride a couple days before the wide release.

Cynthia and Ariana Grande were exceptional throughout they both deserve praise for their performances/exciting vibes! I had a long day I was little achy that was my complication otherwise this was delightful charming gem that will most likely be appreciated by most audiences as should be.",284,262

It was hard to hear what they were saying in some of the songs, so that took away being submerged into the experience. That being said, the whole movie is beautiful, and they did a great job with the graphics. It captured the emotional story of wicked and the cast was great! I wasn't sure how I'd like Ariana as Glinda, but she fit the role perfectly! Elphaba was the star of the show! Great acting and looking beautiful in every scene! She made you relate and humanized the wicked witch well. Great Job on this one, I can't wait to see it again with better sound!

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Spectacular,rpaulcano,2024/11/21,10,"Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande aren't just actresses - they're pure magic on screen! Their live performances breathe extraordinary life into Elphaba and Glinda, transforming these legendary characters into something breathtakingly real. Every note they sing feels like an emotional revelation, making you forget you're watching a movie and instead making you feel like you're experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime theatrical moment.

The production design is absolutely stunning - every visual element feels meticulously crafted to transport you directly into the world of Oz. From costume details to set pieces, nothing feels accidental; everything tells a story. Grande and Erivo don't just perform these roles; they inhabit them with such incredible depth and nuance that you can't imagine anyone else playing these characters.

What truly sets this adaptation apart is its raw, unfiltered emotional authenticity. When they sing live, you're not just hearing a song - you're witnessing a profound storytelling experience. Their chemistry is electric, their individual performances are breathtaking, and their collective magic is something that will be remembered for years to come.

I am very familiar with the original Wizard of Oz and spectacular musical Wicked, but this movie caught the magic of both musicals together seamlessly. Cynthia's performance was absolutely astonishing and made me audibly gasp at least 20 times throughout the movie. Her effortless voice and acting made it clear that she deserved and needed this role. Ariana especially captured the spirit of Glinda easily and her opera singing was pure talent and genius. The director, who is one of my absolute favorites, clearly knew what to do with this movie in his hands. Bravo!",13,36

They really pulled it off!

This was in no way a cash grab or a movie made just for the sake of making it. You can Feel how much effort and love went into every aspect of what you see, hear, and feel throughout.

I can't wait to see it again and again and again.

My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Looking forward to part two of this movie series. I am sure that fans who love the play will also enjoy this movie adaptation of Wicked. Well done to the entire crew and actors who made this movie a reality! This will surely be a well-loved movie (young or old) for the many years to come. 💚💖",6,22
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Great movie from someone who doesn't like musicals,devinkasprick,2024/11/21,9,"As a hard critic who doesn't typically enjoy musicals, I was thoroughly captivated by ""Wicked"" starring Ariana Grande. Having no prior knowledge of the musical or its plot, I entered the theater with minimal expectations. To my surprise, the film kept me engaged from start to finish. Visually, it's a masterpiece-each scene is a feast for the eyes with stunning cinematography and vibrant settings. The emotional moments hit hard, resonating on a level I didn't anticipate. Ariana Grande's performance was exceptional, bringing depth and nuance to her character that added to the film's overall impact. It's entertaining, heartfelt, and visually appealing. I would gladly watch it again and am eagerly awaiting Part 2. Despite my usual reservations about musicals, ""Wicked"" earns a solid 9 out of 10 from me-a high score considering my critical stance on films.",10,28

At the end of the movie I really just sat there thinking WOW. I really enjoyed the characters. Ariana and Cynthia were both great. Cynthia was a surprise as I was not familiar with her before this movie. Her acting was good and her singing was fantastic.

Ariana played her role very well. She was funny and as usual, had an amazing voice! It is good to see her delve back into acting, as this I what she was known for at the beginning of her career!

I look very much forward to Part 2 and how it will tie into The Wizard of Oz.",6,21
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Solid Adaption,brianjohnson-20043,2024/11/21,8,"I went in skeptical that it would be any good divided into 2 parts. I've seen the musical, heard the music a bunch, but only got about 1/4 of the way through the book.

The runtime for part 1 is about 2 hours and 45 minutes, which is about the runtime of the entire musical with the intermission. So I was wondering what would receive the extra time, and would it kill the musical vibe? I was scared of the possibility of something like the hobbit movies where new added storylines developed to justify the longer runtime.

I've got to say that I thought the pacing was perfectly fine in spite of the giant difference from the musical. The added scenes were a mix of added or elongated scenes between songs and during existing songs to further develop the core characters or display the world with the better visuals available to a movie vs a stage show. They put more effort into establishing Elphaba's sympathy towards the Animals, which I liked: The closeups of Glinda allow for a better sense of her character's flaw of caring a bit too much about what others think and not being as true to herself as Elphaba who doesn't have the luxury or having a lot of people care for her thoughts even if she tries.

They didn't add any new musical numbers, or change much of the original songs. The actors were all terrific from an acting perspective. From a singing perspective they were all great apart from Michele Yeoh who only sings the beginning of The Wizard and I. Thankfully that only lasted a few seconds. Ariana Grande in particular seemed perfect for her part. The cameos for the original Broadway due was enjoyable and not too much or too little (IMO).

Overall it was a fun time at the theater, and a good example of how you can be pay tribute to the original while also making it something more for the different media form.

My 8/10 is largely due to me not feeling confident that part 2 will live up to part 1. We will have to wait and see.",7,19

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"Good, but Needed Trimming",dporter2-1,2024/11/21,7,"The singing and dancing in Wicked Part 1 were very good, and the opening was captivating, but the pleasure gradually waned as the movie went on, and on ... and on. By the final ten minutes or so I was praying they would stop singing and just wrap it up. I love music and musicals, so this was an unusual reaction on my part.

Before going to see this, I hadn't realised it was only part 1. That was a bit disappointing. I also never realised the film was so long. Two hours and forty minutes will delight some, but for me, the story and production weren't tight enough to keep me engaged to the end.

From this novice's viewpoint, the editing was done with love rather than with a view to creating a tight film. There were many scenes that would have benefitted from some cuts, without losing any of the overall delight.",70,76
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Incredible,apmkyid,2024/11/21,10,"Seen the stage show many many times so have high expectations. They absolutely nailed it, it's phenomenal. Ariana stole the show with her performance, she was amazing, she really channeled kristin chenoweth's version of Glinda which I always thought that no one could portray this version but Ariana did an amazing job. I will be shocked if the film doesn't win any wards, the sets were incredible, the costumes were exquisite, the acting was outstanding and the film was one of my favourite I've had the privilege to see.

Go and see the movie, it's funny, beautiful to watch and and a great family film to be enjoyed by everyone.

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Wicked Brings Oz to Life Like Never Before,iamianiman,2024/11/21,7,"There's something special about a story that takes the fantastical and makes it feel achingly real. Wicked, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, casts a spell that doesn't just transport you to the world of Oz-it pulls you into a tale of friendship, resilience, and self-discovery that lingers long after the final note fades.

From the very first scene, it's clear that Wicked isn't just a musical-it's an experience. The songs don't overwhelm the story; they blend seamlessly with the dialogue, creating a rhythm that's as natural as it is enchanting. This balance is rare in musicals, and it's what makes Wicked so exceptional. Think The Greatest Showman... yes, now you get it.

At its heart are two women who couldn't be more different yet are bound by a connection that changes them forever. Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba is a powerhouse of vulnerability and strength, a character who's been cast aside and judged for her differences. Erivo doesn't just play Elphaba; she becomes her. Every note, every glance, every heartbreak feels raw and real.

And then there's Ariana Grande as Glinda. If you've ever doubted Grande's acting chops, prepare to be proven wrong. Her Glinda is charmingly narcissistic, with a heart buried beneath layers of self-absorption that only Elphaba can bring to the surface. Watching Grande navigate Glinda's quirks and insecurities is pure joy. She's funny, lovable, and utterly magnetic, and her voice? It soars.

But what truly sets Wicked apart is its portrayal of friendship. There's no need for grand speeches or clichéd declarations-the story unfolds through actions, unspoken emotions, and, of course, music. Every shared glance, every sacrifice, every melody is a testament to the bond between these two women. It's rare to see a musical lean so heavily on the power of relationships without veering into sentimentality, and Wicked nails it.

Visually, the film is a marvel. The sets are grand yet immersive, bursting with color and life, making Oz feel like a place you could reach out and touch. It's fantasy at its finest-vibrant, majestic, and brimming with energy. You can feel the effort poured into every frame, from the sweeping landscapes to the intricate costumes.

Of course, no film is without its flaws. At nearly three hours, the runtime is indulgent, and a few scenes drag more than they should. And while the songs are beautiful, they don't have the staying power of The Greatest Showman or La La Land. Some emotional moments are slightly undercut by abrupt musical transitions, making them feel less impactful than they could have been.

But these are minor quibbles in a film that delivers so much. Wicked is more than a musical-it's a celebration of humanity, filled with themes of acceptance, equality, and the power of friendship. It's a story that resonates, especially for anyone who's ever felt like an outsider.

By the end, you won't just be humming the tunes-you'll be reflecting on the journey, the emotions, and the connections that make life meaningful.

Verdict: Wicked is a spellbinding journey of friendship, identity, and perseverance, brought to life through stunning visuals and heartfelt performances. While its runtime occasionally lingers and its songs may not all be instant classics, the film's charm, emotional depth, and magical storytelling shine through. Whether you're a lifelong fan or new to this world, Wicked offers an unforgettable cinematic experience that will leave you inspired, enchanted, and humming long after the credits roll. However, for those who aren't fans of musicals, this one may not cast the same spell.",13,30
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"""Wicked"" is a lavish film, one of the best of the year.",jp_91,2024/11/21,10,"""Wicked"" is a top-notch film, managing to excel within the seventh art.

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Give Cynthia Erivo an Academy Award,SawyerSaiyan,2024/11/21,8,"As far as musicals go, I've never been one to indulge all that often. But when Wicked was advertised as coming to cinemas, my curiosity was piqued and I bit the bullet. Needless to say, my hasty decision was not in vain.

As a long-time and passionate fan of The Wizard of Oz (1939), I had very high expectations that the world building would be magnificent. I was very glad to see that wish come to life on the silver screen, through the talented acting of Ariana, Cynthia, and the rest of the cast.

Cynthia - in particular - deserves a golden globe for her outstanding portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West, also known as Elphaba. Her character building is phenomenal; every expression that lines her face, from happy, to sad, to disappointed, makes you feel what she does. It makes you feel as though you're right there with her, and I adore the cinematographers for that.",8,20
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Asolid character study of two very different witches and the origins of their unlikely friendship,MrDHWong,2024/11/21,8,"""Wicked: Part I"" is a fantasy musical film based on the 2003 stage musical and 1995 novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire, which themselves are both based around L. Frank Baum's novel ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"". Directed by Jon M. Chu (""Now You See Me 2"", ""Crazy Rich Asians"") and starring Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Michelle Yeoh, and Jeff Goldblum, it is a solid character study of two very different witches and the origins of their unlikely friendship.

Years before the events of ""The Wizard of Oz"", the shy, reserved Elphaba Thropp (Cynthia Erivo) and the pampered, perky Galinda Upland (Ariana Grande) both arrive at Shiz University to study magic. Because of her prominent green skin, Elphaba is quickly judged and ridiculed by others whereas Galinda's bubbly personality gains her many friends among the students. After demonstrating a fraction of her power in front of the whole university, Elphaba attracts the attention of Headmistress Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), who decides to tutor her in private, much to the chagrin of Galinda. Eventually, Elphaba and Galinda are forcibly assigned together as roommates where their conflicting views often put them at odds with each other, leading to many fights and disagreements. Over time, the pair find themselves growing closer as friends after learning more about each other's personal lives, as well as delving deep into some dark, sinister secrets in relation to the history of the Land of Oz.

Few modern fairy tales have captured our imaginations the way L. Frank Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" continues to do so up to this very day. Thanks to the classic 1939 film, Baum's Land of Oz lives on in the hearts and minds of several people the world over, even more than a century after the original novel was published. In the wake of the story's long-lasting popularity, various spin-offs and prequels in the form of books, comics, films, TV series, and stage productions have emerged to help keep it relevant within western pop culture, but hardly any have achieved the level of success like the 2003 Broadway musical ""Wicked"". After years of development, in 2024 we now have the first part of two film adaptations of this highly successful musical, which manages to translate surprisingly efficiently onto the big screen.

Serving as a prequel to the 1939 film, this story shows the audience the origins of its two distinguished witch characters; The Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch. As the film begins, we see a mighty cheer go up among the citizens of Oz as they all celebrate the death of the Wicked Witch at the hands of Dorothy Gale. Amidst a town of celebrating Munchkins, Glinda suddenly appears in her bubble to check in on their festivities, where one of the young inhabitants inquires as to whether or not the two witches have ever crossed paths with each other. With a subtle hint of sadness, Glinda begins to tell the Munchkins about how she not only knew the Wicked Witch personally, but that she was actually once her closest friend when no one else wanted to be.

At this point, the film then flashes back several years earlier where we see the birth of Elphaba, whose green skin horrifies both her parents and everyone around them. As she grows older, Elphaba is subjected to numerous cruel reactions regarding her appearance, so much so that she even has a mentally scripted response ready for anybody polite enough to listen. In spite of her hardships, Elphaba still tries to be a good person, learning how to master magic and using it as a way to help others. This is later shown to us when we see Elphaba protect her wheelchair-bound younger sister Nessarose (Marissa Bode) from bullies using her developing magical powers.

On the other hand, the upbringing of Glinda, then known as ""Galinda"", was one of happiness and luxury. Her exuberant family life among the wealthy elite has turned her into something of a snob, viewing herself as of a higher social status than most others in the Land of Oz. All of this changes on her first day at Shiz University, where she becomes acquainted with Elphaba, whose unusual physical features causes her to stand out even more so than Galinda's predominantly pink fashion sense. This is where the film begins to examine the complex relationship between the two characters, exploring the vast differences in their demeanours and how they eventually find common ground. Being a musical, these moments are of course accomplished through some creative song and dance routines.

Having never watched the original musical live on stage, I am unable to properly compare this film to its source material, but from what I can gather it appears to be a faithful retelling of the story, albeit, in cinematic form. As such, I treated this film as I would any other musical, to which I can say it is very effective in the way it incorporates its music numbers into the plot. For instance, when Galinda and Elphaba are seen disagreeing with each other, the song ""What Is This Feeling?"" is used to showcase their contrasting personalities, whereas ""Dancing Through Life"" demonstrates how much the two have grown since their initial hostilities and have now become close friends. All of these moments feature catchy audio hooks and well-choreographed dance sequences which help the film stand out from other musicals while at the same time giving the impression it belongs to the same universe as ""The Wizard of Oz"".

In terms of visuals, the film looks vibrant and colourful, making it hard to look away during certain establishing shots. From the distinct pink of Galinda's wardrobe to the light-green interiors of the Emerald City, the film uses its colour palette quite efficiently. Not only that, but the overall production design is handled nicely too, with some interesting props for the cast of singers and actors to interact with during the musical numbers. However, there were a handful of scenes where it felt quite obvious that the actors were working in front of a green screen under the impression that the background will be made to look beautiful in post production. Though these moments weren't too common, they did stand out during times where I wanted to feel fully immersed in this fantastical world of Oz, which is something pretty important for a film like this.

Since this is a two woman show, it feels necessary to praise both Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande at the same time. Each of these two actresses compliment the other perfectly with their conflicting dynamic being the main dramatic force that drives the plot forward. I actually found myself heavily invested in watching how Erivo's Elphaba grows increasingly darker over the course of the story whereas Grande's Galinda becomes less snooty and more humble as she learns the importance of true friendship. As an added bonus, both actresses did all of their own singing, which adds a sense of realism to their performances on screen. Of course, Erivo and Grande are no strangers to singing on stage as they have each performed in various other Broadway shows in the past. The only other two cast members worth mentioning are Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but as much as I would like to go into greater detail regarding their characters, I am unable to do so due to either spoilers or information that will likely be addressed in the film's second part.

For fans of both musicals and the ""Wizard of Oz"" series, the first film adaptation of ""Wicked"" succeeds not only at bringing the popular Broadway show to the big screen but also at adding some interesting backstory and lore to keep novices entertained for most of its 160 minute runtime. Granted, it is clear that the scope of the entire story is far too grandiose for just one film, which is why Part Two should hopefully cover everything else that wasn't properly examined here. Regardless, this first part of the story does a fine job setting the stage for things to come and leaves you with just enough to keep you satisfied before the follow-up eventually arrives. With that said, I can only hope its successor will conclude things on an equally enjoyable note, because I'll be waiting patiently until then.

I rate it 8/10.",21,43
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Overlong But Wickedly Beautiful Tale,SAMTHEBESTEST,2024/11/21,6,"Wicked (2024) : Movie Review -

Over the years, we have known the Wicked Witch of the West as a wicked queen/witch from Victor Fleming's cult musical from 1939, The Wizard of Oz (one of the top favorite musicals of all time). Well, that film is more about Dorothy (Judy Garland's most memorable role ever, even better than Star Is Born) than Glinda and the Wicked Witch. Gregory Maguire decided to bring the backstory of the Wicked Witch in 1995 and gave birth to a memorable Broadway show that has become one of those rare Broadway shows to join the $1 billion club with blockbuster ticket sales. Job M. Chu, whom I admire so much for giving one of the finest musicals of our times, In The Heights (2021), finally brings the Broadway blockbuster to the silver screen. Though I wasn't expecting much, I am glad to say that Chu's efforts are worth it. Wicked is a beautiful musical, just the way everyone wanted it to be, and the good thing is that it's not over yet. It's just half of the story, and it's still so delightful.

The wife of the governor of Munchkinland is having an extramarital affair, and she gives birth to a green baby. The father loathes her. That baby is grown up to be Elphaba Thropp (Cynthia Erivo), a green girl with no one to love. She has a paraplegic sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), who goes to join Shiz, a university of wizarding. There they encounter a selfish, I-am-the-best, and self-loving popular beauty queen, Galinda (Ariana Grande). The next moment Elphapa puts her supernatural powers on display and stuns everyone in the university, including Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), who takes her under her wings, much to Galinda's jealousy. Elphie and Galinda share the same room, but not emotions and friendship. The picture changes halfway when Elphie puts in her word for Galinda before Madame, and then they become besties. A handsome boy, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), arrives at the university and instantly mingles with Galinda and her attitude, only to fall for Elphie later. Amidst this, Elphie is invited to the palace by the Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum), but what happens then that makes this kind-hearted and selfless Elphie declared as the wicked witch and enemy of Oz? Find out your answers in the film.

The screenplay by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox beautifully adapts the Broadway phenomenon and somehow makes it grander because of ""cinematic"" advantages. Here, you can show everything on a larger level and can go out of the world too, something that one can't do on stage. But more than that, the beauty of the film lies in those small small conversations and line-up of events that are simply gorgeous. Two girls are writing a letter to their own fathers, different thoughts but the same lines, and both come together in a split screen. Beautiful. Elphie enters the party with the granny's hat, and everyone is laughing at her; at the same moment, Galinda starts feeling awful because she has discovered that Elphapa wasn't wrong, but instead they all were wrong to her. Elphie's humiliating dance steps become hook steps! Such a highly influential scene for many films over the years. The guy who has fallen for the wrong girl has started ""thinking."" I mean, that's so ""thoughtful."" There are so many small small scenes like this that make Wicked a wholesome experience, but yes, goodness always comes with a few compromises. So, yes, we have a few flaws here.

The dramatic ending is stretched. The girl is falling down from high and sees images of childhood; that's so childish for modern cinema. Come on, grow up; it's 2024. Not 2004. The biggest drawback of Wicked is its overlong narrative. I mean, you are not making something astonishing like ""Hamilton,"" where every single minute counts and every single line in musicals is worth something. Let's just accept that you are making a simple, decent film and not a masterpiece and move on ahead with some ordinary scenes. Why stick to being extraordinary when you have no potential? You don't have any magical number like ""Over the Rainbow""; you don't have characters like Scarecrow, Tin Man, or Shivering Lion, so don't try to imitate something that's not possible. The screenplay denies accepting this basic fact and unnecessarily stretches the narrative to a useless extent. That could have been avoided, especially on the edit desk.

Cynthia Erivo's performance is one of the most effective things in the entire film. Ariana Grande's Galinda even puts Margot Robbie's Barbie at a low with her girlie affairs and over-the-top attitude. Michelle Yeoh shines as Madame, and Jeff Goldblum was pretty decent as the wizard. Jonathan Bailey plays a very nice character, and there is some depth to his character. It's just that the screenplay doesn't allow him to have those subtle scenes. Ethan Slater and Marissa Bode passed the time, and Bronwyn James, Keala Seattle, and Bowen Yang were casually okay. Nothing big wrong with the cast, so no complaints, but there wasn't really anything impressive either except the leading ladies.

The visual effects are occasionally fascinating, and 3D design sets the mood right for 3D and IMAX viewing. I, once again, had to see it in a resized ratio on the IMAX screen, so the impact wasn't really up to the mark. Alice Brooks' framework is nice; Myron Kerstein's editing sucks at trimming 15 minutes more and making it an engaging affair. Some musical numbers are worthy, some are a little boring, but the visual expansion is brilliant. Thanks to those visuals, or else I would have left my seat at least 4-5 times more than the intermission break. Step Up 3D, Crazy Rich Asians, and In The Heights, Jon M. Chu hasn't made a bad film with a musical boost yet. Wicked tops the dance flick, not the other two or one, but it's not far. That's a solid graph, Mr. Chu. He knows what he's dealing with, so it's only about that overlong runtime. For years, you have termed her as the Wicked Witch, but was she really that bad? Or was she even bad at all? On the other hand, Glinda has been popular and loved, but was she really that good? Wicked will force you to think otherwise and most probably will change your perception about the Wicked Witch and Glinda. So, if you love musicals and some of our nostalgic fantasies/novels, then head straight to the cinema hall near you and catch Wicked. Enjoy wickedness like never before!

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"Fly, Don't Run to Wicked: Part 1",Sassy2_9,2024/11/21,9,"The complexities of adapting a modern age Broadway musical that is so beloved by millions is a daunting enough challenge. When you take the material from wicked, that is a whole new ball game. Jon M Chu is able to definitely handle this task and really takes great advantage of all of the incredibly talented Craftsman at his disposal when making this film. There is nothing that is overlooked and things are beautifully set up for a seamless transition into the second part of the story next year. I've seen people complain about some of the effects from the opening, not necessarily working as well with the practical sets and I disagree, I think Oz is able to come to life in a beautiful way because we allow ourselves to be immersed in the world now on the other end, we have a magnificent cast that really puts the work in to tell a very big story. Cynthia Erivo was made to play this part, and she is effortless and detailed in her emotional journey as Elphaba . It is very difficult to do what she's doing, which is to bring a real person to a very beloved caricature from the past almost hundred years. And you can absolutely see the journey ahead Ariana Grande really earns every laugh and gives her whole heart as Galinda the story. Everyone keeps telling about the 10-year-old that went and saw the Broadway show is absolutely evident in this performance. I actually think that there's a little too much bonding that happens very quickly between these two, but I love it and it's a great choice still. Jonathan Bailey as Fierro brings so much more life and depth to what can be a very two dimensional character, especially one who is just utilized for the most part as a love interest in the show he can't help but bring depth to every role he takes, and this is no exception. Michelle Yeo, Jeff Goldblum, Ethan Slater, and Marissa Bode round out the cast, and each of them pushes through with a wonderfully deft performance. I need to shout out Nathan Crowley for his production design, Winnie Holtzman for her script, and Christopher Scott for the choreography. Each of these individuals did things that I felt was holy original to this film and in Holtzman's case she was able to take her same script from Broadway and really go through and pull things that didn't necessarily work and enhance other moments to fill in the story and give us a 160 minute film that for me absolutely flew by. They earned the part one status honestly, some people may not like this movie or musical or they just may not like musicals in general, but you cannot fault the efforts that have been laid out. This movie has been given so much care and love and the performances are so heartfelt. I highly recommend seeing wicked and I absolutely recommend enjoying this film with friends or family and giving yourself this treat.",6,21
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,My eyes are bleeding and my brain is dying from how bad this movie was,shollykoslowitz,2024/11/21,1,"If your going to watch wicked, be prepared for two hours and forty minutes of absolute torture. This movie is a prime example of them putting so much lessons in a movie they forgot to make a story line. Seriously, the first 10 minutes were ok but it was all downhill from there. It was so absolutely mindnumbingly boring that at least 8 people left half way through. You know how some shows they offer promotional items for sale like a themed popcorn box? They should offer green advil or something. Every ""plot twist"" was predictable, every song was just cringe. Over all, a waste of two hours and forty minutes, even for die hard fans of the book. If my worst enemy asked me what to watch I couldn't bring myself to recommend this trash.",156,187
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Absolutely Phenomal !,turnbucklecollectibles,2024/11/21,10,There are no words to truly describe how absolutely fantastic this movie is. It is easily the best musical film adaptation of all time and is an instant classic any review to the contrary is completely inaccurate.. The world building is on par with Harry Potter and Lord of the rings. You get completely immersed in it and the music is absolutely fantastic. Ariana Grande as Glinda is a perfect love letter to Kristin Chenoweth while at the same time still remaining boil to herself. Cynthia Ervo was a perfect choice for Elphaba and she really makes you care about the character. The movie and it's a hole was cast brilliantly and me and my family were moved to tears during many of the numbers.,6,13
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,She was a 10 out of 10,ejfinestone,2024/11/21,0,"I just emerged from the most enchanting cinematic experience of the year - the new Wicked movie! As a huge fan of the original Broadway musical, I was blown away by the faithfulness and creativity of this adaptation.

Ariana Grande dazzles as Glinda, delivering impressive vocals and comedic charm.


The production design is stunning:

New arrangements and orchestrations add fresh excitement.


Director Jon M. Chu masterfully balances action, drama, and heart.

Supporting performances from Ethan Slater (Boq) and Jonathan Bailey (Fiyero) add delightful depth.

Minor quibbles aside, this Wicked adaptation is an unforgettable experience.

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,"Masterpiece, literally",heidisabrina-47036,2024/11/21,10,Absolutely perfect in every way. Almost. The colors in some scenes are dim and defying gravity almost loses its impact from being dragged out. But saves itself. This film is a wicked masterpiece. It should be the gold standard for musical adaptations. It's better than it should be. The cast is perfect as well as the production values. The film doesn't feel long or draggy. The effects are good as well as the cgi. The story is improved on as well as an added mini song. Everyone should see it. The only other flaw is that Ethan an Ariana's scenes are awkward. We need part two sooner than next year!,6,22
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Good adaptation of an OK show,mjanelle-24974,2024/11/21,7,"I'll preface this with the fact that Wicked has never been my favorite musical (read, I am not a superfan). I don't have all the memorabilia. I've seen the show twice, once a touring company in Miami, and once in London with my husband (who is relatively new to musical theater). Both were enjoyable experiences, but did not leave me swooning in my seat or humming the score coming out the theater. The save for one or two songs, the music is mediocre, the story kind of thin, and the characters flat. This adaptation does not improve on these things.

That being said, I will review Wicked in its filmmaking elements.

Visually it is stunning. The bright colors, the sets, the costumes and hair design, the tiny details (I imagine it would take several viewings to catch them all) make this a satisfying entertainment in themselves. Without knowing the budget (I'm sure it was huge) you can tell that ever cent spent is up there on the screen, and money well spent.

The acting is mostly superb. Cynthia Arivo is excellent as Elphaba, although her vocals tend to be a bit uneven. Great on the belted anthems, but iffy on the more quiet pieces. Ariana Grande, pop princess extraordinaire, is the surprise of the show with amazing and surprisingly full vocals, and excellent and nuanced comic timing. Jonathan Bailey is fine but underused as Fiyero, but shows off his singing and dancing talents (which earned him an Olivier a few years ago pre-COVID). Michelle Yeoh and Jeff Goldblum each play versions of themselves (or perhaps rather their other best known characters) and show a (very) little bit of vocal ability (because it IS a musical after all). There's a little bit of unnecessary stunt casting (hello, Bowen Yang) and some fun cameos (Stephen Schwartz as one of the Oz Palace guards, and the original Broadway Glinda - Kristin Chenoweth - and Elphaba - Idina Menzel - in a playful musical interaction with the film versions of their characters).

Biggest complaint - This is ACT I or a two-act musical. And it is, in and of itself, as long as the entire show on Broadway (including intermission). Granted they are able to expand the Land of Oz much more than can be done on stage, and fill out the story a bit. But much could have been cut and tightened and still made made for an enjoyable movie.

This is a bright, airy bauble of a movie. There are no great revelations and, despite the expanded running time, the story remains as thin as the original.

My biggest fear is that instead of a unified story between the two parts (Part 2 coming a year from now) we will have on our hands two completely different stories, as Act II of the musical is much darker in tone than Act I. Perhaps this will allow the story to expand and deepen. We can hope.",14,29
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Hard to review the movie without reviewing the musical,richard-1787,2024/11/21,9,"I have never seen the stage show on which this is based, so it's hard for me to review just the movie and not the musical as well.

I thought the movie was well done, with an outstanding performance by Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, followed not far behind by Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible. I found Jeff Goldblum remarkably flat as the Wizard, but maybe that was the director's intent. I had problems heading some of what Ariana Grande sang or spoke sometimes, but that was probably the result of poor sound engineering rather than faulty diction or projection.

The graphics were certainly remarkable.

But for me there were far too many musical numbers because all of them, to me, were unmemorable. Harold Arlen's songs for the 1939 movie are ALL memorable, every last one of them, and several very striking. There is also a wide variety, from ""We're off to see the Wizard"" to ""Somewhere over the rainbow."" None of the numbers in this movie stuck with me. Not a one.

This movie covers only the first half of the musical, and it's already way too long, 2h40. It should have been severely cut - as, by the way, was the 1939 movie, which is 1h42 and flies by like lightening. Yes, the new musical tries to touch on several important social issues, but in most cases it just touches on them, and then suddenly all is well. None of them is explored with any depth.

Accepting difference is certainly the most obvious of these issues. We have severe problems with racism in this country not because Blacks look different than whites, but because white America has built up a whole mythology making Blacks both inferior and dangerous. It is a different, and far more pernicious, man-made ""difference"" than lack of acceptance for overweight people, for example, as a result.

The fact that there were stereotypically nasty characters who were effeminate male and overweight female didn't help matters any.

Fans of the musical may like this movie. Those around me in the packed movie theater did last night. But those who don't care about the stage show may wonder what all the hype is about.",5,11
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Great adaptation,StephenRoa,2024/11/21,9,"Amazingly done. Ariana hit every step and note. Cynthia was beautiful and performed with her heart. Would recommend to all Wicked lovers.

Michelle, ugh. I love her but i do wish it was differently casted. Someone who could play a but more devious.

Jeff was OK but that about it. Idk who else could have played the Wizard but it probably could have been someone else.

The animals do have small part but i wanted them to be a bit more humanoid than just being completely CGI - there was enough in the movie.

Overall would watch again and ill be waiting for the second movie.

I think others should be more open minded.",6,17
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Absolutely loved it!,AVA_T1984,2024/11/21,10,"Perfect casting, this movie more than dazzled. Ariana and Cynthia are absolute stars. The vocals on Cynthia gave me goosebumps every time she sang. Really can't fault the movie. The graphics were great also, wicked is just better experienced on the big screen. Bowen Yang was a great addition to Glindas pose, the comedy really came to life with these two. Definitely a few tear jerker moments but mostly upbeat. I think original Broadway fans will not be disappointed. Loved it and so glad there's two parts to this, true fans will appreciate what the directors tried to capture here. 10 stars from me.",6,13
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,the theater come to life,paytonrian,2024/11/21,9,"I've been acting for 6 years from elementary school to college. I went into this movie as a fan of the original broadway production and an Ariana Grande fan. I came out of the theater as that little girl excited to put on a costume and act. This movie takes musical theater and enhances it with gorgeous sets, an incredible score, and, well, Wicked casting ;) Cynthia is powerful yet delicate and her voice is groundbreaking. Ariana exceeded my expectations and her physical comedy is a delight. Jon M Chu NEEDS to direct more and more; his choices for this film were carefully selected and placed. He gives this broadway show so much respect and room to breathe. Give the whole cast an Oscar. Seriously! The only reason I rate it a 9 is because if you are not familiar with the play it seems bit fast paced in terms of plot. However, with part 2 coming out next year I have no doubt audiences of all kinds will be back for more. Overall this was a stunning film.",7,19
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Fly don't run to see this magical piece !!!,melaniab,2024/11/21,10,"People doubted some of the actors and if this would hold up to the original it's such a special story the magic isn't easy to capture so I understand . I can tell you though from a fan herself ... the acting from every single person, the singing with raw emotion , the dancing with the most energy possible and overall storytelling in this movie version is unlike anything I've ever seen just like on broadway it's hard to explain but you won't be disappointed going to see this movie trust you need to see this it's once and a lifetime. Even if you've never seen anything of this story if you've felt out of place if you felt unheard or misunderstood you'll be happy to see it portrayed this way ! I've honestly been changed for the better because of this movie sitting in the theater crying being brought back to my younger self . The only thing I'm upset about is waiting a whole year for part 2 !!",6,16
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,I cried so hard!!!,macykimpson,2024/11/21,10,"I had my doubts about this movie due to the feeling that Ariana was less nasily than the Broadway's Glinda and I felt like the emotions wouldn't be the same due to that and it would sound pop. Which it was more pop but I wasn't as disappointed as I thought I was however disappointed at the fact there was strong autotune for these amazing singers. The background is so magical and since seeing it on broadway it made me cry seeing it come to life. The costuming was amazing too but I kinda felt like theire was a lack of emotion in parts of the songs like popular were great but still lacked the emotion in the voice. On screen it was there but I feel like autotune ruined it and voices were mellow instead of exaggerated but on screen the dances were great. Overall the movie was amazing and that's why I'm still rating it highly and a perfect score.

If I could rate this higher than 10 starts, I would. GO SEE IT. You will not be disappointed. The whole theater was in tears walking out. Ariana played that part better than I could ever imagine and so did Cynthia. It's only been 16 hours since i watched it and I can't stop thinking about it. The additions didn't ruin a thing.

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Misleading,gigielizamotes,2024/11/21,4,"I was excited at first about this movie when I first heard about but was deeply disappointed by it.

I was surprised by the press tour leading up that no had talked about Nessa Rose at ALL. Or the fact that Elphaba is the main character when the marketing is all about Ariana. She does not need to be nominated for an Oscar as this is not an Oscar worthy film. The music was superb but Ariana Grande was trying WAY TOO hard to be like Kristen Chenoweth as Galinda/Glinda. You could tell by the acting/mannerisms for her felt very Disney/Nickelodeon.

While the other cast members were fantastic.

I have seen the musical in person so I was indeed expecting the background to match the vibe of the film as the coloring was great.

I am giving it a 4 of Ariana's performance kind of ruined it for me while the supporting cast as well as Cynthia Erivo were great.",21,24
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Brings World of Oz Back to Life,funfitnessfamily,2024/11/21,9,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but it far exceeded my expectations!

It focuses on the untold fascinating story of not only the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, but also Glinda the ""Good"" Witch.

This movie expertly cast with triple Emmy, Grammy and Tony award winning Cynthia Erivo paired up with the petite superstar Ariana Grande. And Jeff Goldblum makes the perfect Wizard!

It also brings to life the same whimsical world full of imaginative characters created in the original musical fantasy The Wizard of Oz.

The only knock I can give it is that there are a few songs that go on a bit too long. The movie runs 2 hours and 40 minutes so sit on the aisle if you have a small bladder

Mom Advice It is rated PG for mild violence and themes. I would not suggest it for kids under 6 because it may be hard for them to sit that long and the story will most likely be over their heads.

The film is only half the story leaving you with a dash of closure and a dash of intrigue. You'll have to wait until November 2025 for Wicked Part Two!",4,10

2,Wicked,2024/11/22,A Raucous Disneyland Ride,tylerkom,2024/11/21,7,"I'm aware this isn't a Disney film, but damn is it not more magical and mystical than anything Disney has put out in the last few years.

Wicked (now rebranded to Wicked Part 1...) is Hollywood's next try at a film adaptation an eponymous Broadway musical and wow, do they go all out. The sets are limitless and beautiful. The costumes and design are detailed, colorful, and glimmering. The gags come and go quickly, but are a joy to experience with the character. It's no doubt that so much love and effort went into the production of this film. Somehow despite its nearly 3 hour runtime for HALF of a full production, the film only feels overly long near the very end. Throughout that runtime, we watch a refreshingly natural progression of Elphaba and Galinda turning from enemies to frenemies to (best) friends. It has the same arc as a high school coming of age film, albeit a mature and well crafted one. Beyond this main arc, there are tons of side characters with their own dreams and desires, and adding to the big world that Jon Chu has created, makes this world seem bustling and bubbling. Ariana Grande does a surprisingly great job in her role as the privileged airhead Galinda, truly carrying the comic relief and heart of the film. There is certainly quite a bit of 'theatrical' acting, which probably suits her best as Grande most likely doesn't have the chops for modern acting. Erivo does a solid job as Elphaba, nothing so outstanding on the acting front, but gets the job done and crushes the musical portions.

And those musical portions sure are dazzling. Ginormous set pieces and sets and intermittent shots make the music sections wonderous and huge. This music was solid throughout, no technical issues with that. Not really my cup of tea, but Erivo's performance of 'Gravity' gave me chills.

A film like this was never trying to be capital A Art, bbut it sure is a capital M Movie. The pacing is surprisingly great for such a long runtime, although I certainly think 5-10 minutes could have been cut somewhere along the line. Furthermore, the acting/writing is frequently in that style of Broadway that some will find either overly stiff or entrancing -- at times I felt both. One last compliment: I have been critical of Part 1/Part2 films before for disrespecting the audience with only half of a story, but Wicked 1 leaves us with a truly complete arc in Elphaba's transformation to become the witch and a satisfying journey. Maybe it's Hollywood doing the bare minimum, but I appreciate it.

It's a joyride on rails!",6,18
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,One Of The Greatest Musicals Of All Time,PrinceCharmingHere,2024/11/21,10,"In an era where musicals are deemed unsafe and a guarantee box office poison, Wicked defies gravity and transcends expectations. Not only are the songs infectious and emotionally resonate, but the acting from the cast is equal to the strengths of the music. The movie is visually striking, and though it's a lengthy runtime, the journey the viewer goes on is well worth the trip, leaving one enthralled when the ""To Be Continued"" pops up on screen.

What is also unheard of for a movie musical is being a two parter. I wouldn't be surprised if Wicked: Part 1 sweeps this year's awards, and Part 2 does another sweep, something that is unprecedented in the history of movies.",314,378
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Defies Gravitational Expectations. It's Sure to be Popular!,Reels2Watch,2024/11/21,8,"This musical film totally amazed me. Although it's rather lengthy and there is a lot to take in, it was done fairly well. Director Jon M. Chu did a spectacular adaptation bringing the popular Broadway musical Wicked onto the big screen, which was inspired by the 2003 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire.

Chu takes the audience on an exciting adventure to the wonderful Land of OZ with Wicked. There are many visual references (especially in the intro scene) to the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, which many will find nostalgic. The film expands on the backstory of Elphaba Thropp (Cynthia Erivo), focusing on her childhood and the non-existence relationship with her father Frexspar Thropp (Andy Nyman), yet is close and protective to her younger sister, Nessarose ""Nessa"" Thropp (Marissa Bode). Elphaba's journey begins when she arrives at Shiz University where she meets Galinda ""Glinda"" Upland (Ariana Grande).

Elphaba (Erivo) is seen as the outcast, due to her green appearance and unable to harness her emotions - anger triggers her strong magical ability. While Glinda (Grande) is the privileged popular aristocrat that uses her beauty and charismatic ways to influence others. The students at the Shiz University are just smitten over her. However, Elphaba's powers strike an interest with Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh), which makes Glinda envious.

As the storyline moves along through the catchy musical numbers and dancing, we see how Glinda is the egocentric, pompous manipulator and bullies not just Elphaba but Doctor Dillamond (Peter Dinklage) - the talking goat professor. But, what's a musical without a little drama? Jonathan Bailey is a remarkably good singer and shows off his vocal skills as the handsome, yet shallow Fiyero Tigelaar. Fiyero arrives at the university, you can only think he will be perfect for Galinda but ends up caught in a love triangle between Glinda and Elphaba. This takes Glinda's jealousy to the extreme and sees an opportunity to belittle Elphaba by persuading her to wear the infamous black hat during a student night outing. When Elphaba shows up looking like...a witch, everyone laughs and ridicules her. It gets highly emotional when Elphaba pretends to dismiss their reactions and begins to do swaying dance to no music. Glinda finally realizes that she has gone too far with teasing Elphaba. This scene sets up for the transformation of both Glinda and Elphaba, especially for when they meet the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) master of illusion and exploitation. Not to give out any spoilers, there are so many other details and surpise appearences in this musical that ends in a powerful cliffhanger for Wicked Part II.

Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were the perfect pairing for this film. Both ladies have such powerhouse voices, which complement each other. Regardless that I was never an Ariana Grande fan, she was impressive taking on the role of Galinda - Glinda. She had that character down from the sweet voice, dancing, quirky gestures to the hair flipping. Cynthia Erivo gave an astounding flawless performance and dominated the screen with her incredible voice. I can definitely see her acting career taking off to the next level, ""Defying Gravity""!

Wicked has it all - majestic cinematography, fabulous costumes, best soundtrack, great storyline with solid performances. It will surely be ""Popular"" at the box office.",4,8
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Magnificent,thawkins089,2024/11/22,10,"I agree with the other reviewers. This is a masterpiece. I'm also not a fan of musicals but boy am I glad I saw Wicked. You feel sympathy for Elphaba throughout the movie. I almost felt like I could relate to Elphaba. I'm sure many of us can relate to her, being misunderstood and feeling like an outcast. I almost wanted to cry in the beginning of the movie. I was blown away. The special effects, the acting and the cinematic elements to the movie was top notch. I plan to go see it again. I went to go see the early premiere, at first I thought the movie was gonna suck but I was wrong. This movie is magnificent. I liked watching the chemistry between Cynthia and Ariana. They deserve an award for their roles, the acting and the performance was good from beginning to end. I am so glad I went to see this.",82,153
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Phenomenal Adaptation,eejohnston-56374,2024/11/22,10,"I initially watched this movie in a Big D theatre on Monday as part of the Amazon Prime sneak peak. I just finished watching it for the second time and since I have one of those deals where you can watch 3 movies in a week, I will be going again this Sunday. To say that my expectations for this movie were unfair is an understatement...but, I've seen this on staged and listened to the Broadway soundtrack for two decades. But, I can honestly say that this movie went far beyond my high expectations in delivering a movie that is hands down the best book to stage to movie adaptation I've ever watched. As I sat there stunned with the rest of the audience on Monday, the only word I can think of is ""gobsmacked!"" Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were perfectly cast and managed to make Elphaba and Glinda their own while literally paying homage to Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Grande is exceptional at comedic timing (anyone who's watched her on SNL knows she's hilarious); but, it's when there are more nuanced moments between her Glinda and Erivo's Elphaba where she is at her best. And Erivo's performance? MIND BLOWING! The depth of emotions she conveys with her eyes are scene stealing! Supporting cast is great but I will not be surprised if both Grande and Erivo nab Oscar nominations for this movie.",106,175
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,This is what a 10 movie looks like,thealeciathomas,2024/11/22,10,Just wonderful. The original Wizard of Oz is in my top 5 so there was no doubt I would go see this. I love the soundtrack and have actually read the book. I am The perfect fan I guess for this as art nouveau/steampunk is my jam. Well it was just a stained glass/brass/peacock feathered paradise - the production design is just exquisite in every scene. Anyone who misses the immersive enchanting world of Harry Potter should check this out. The performances were perfect every one I am NOT a fan of Ariana Grandes radio hits but she was born to play Glinda. Michelle Yoeh Jeff goldblum both great but it's Cynthia Ervio who steals the show. What a presence and what a voice. An Oscar would make her an EGOT and she deserves it.,15,37

Summary: A movie offers a means to take the impressive components of the stage and take them to a level conventional props cannot make come to life. Chu's vision is gorgeous and a big screen-worthy display of the power of his imagination. Solid sets mixed with computer animation craft the world described in the Oz literature and unleash them into the splendor and spectacle I always imagined Oz to be. From the stylish costumes that convey the classic world with a new age design to the grandiose cityscapes, Wicked's first part is everything modern that I love in a movie and helped immerse me so much into the world of a magical high school that conveys its emotions through music, dancing, and drama.

The performances are a big part of the show, as you know, and there were giant shoes to fill, given the powerful voices and acting that have preceded this film. For this reviewer (and his three friends), they accomplished much and made these performances their own, but never stepped on the established characters over the last two decades. Erivo hits much of Elphaba's qualities with powerful vocal ranges that fill the screen with a majestic prowess worthy of the Wicked cast. She brings much of that vulnerability and anger to the movie and shows the turmoil that arises and what it can be forged into for her character, truly spellbinding and engaging as the film continues to the climactic number. She may not completely capture the original sarcasm or dryness that comes with the green witch, but she still owns the role and gives her performance everything she can. Grande, on the other hand, is a delightfully wonderful Galinda, bringing the spoiled brat nature out in delightful charm and adding that flighty, airheaded giddiness the Good Witch is famous for holding. Complex sincerity arises, and she is allowed to build more up for the character with fantastic emotion that tangles with Erivo's performance to give the complicated relationship between the two future witches. Her mimicry of Chenowith is spot on at times, and though maybe not as sassy and bullying, she still captures enough of the spoiled girl to be hard to turn away from her delightful delivery of the lines. Their chemistry is unbelievable, and I was engrossed in what these two divas accomplished in bringing the characters to life and making them so emotionally complex.

As for the presentation, the movie shoots for the stars and reaches them by handling the story, or at least part 1 of it. Like the show, Wicked's film manages to add the energy of the stage show but gives its own energy with the additions of the movie. It respects the material, the dance numbers charming, delightful, and holding moments where I feel like I'm watching people jump about in choreographed displays. Yet, the movie also keeps to the emotional ties and the constant bouts of joy, sadness, and more that are balanced throughout the film and never so much to drag the movie into that slow crawl that dramas sometimes fall into when they get to the darker parts. Throw in the musical score and powerful musical ballads that are filled with the same majesty of the play, only now supported by those visual support structures that raise them to incredible heights. It shook the theaters with joy, cascaded the crowd with crazy ranges, unleashed the emotional torrents of the character to startling degrees, and brought the power of the stage with it. Such a balance between everything accomplishes an engaging pace that helps make the nearly three-hour run time feel shorter and never get too out of hand with the changes to bloat the movie too much. And that kind of fun is always welcomed by a reviewer like me when it is accompanied by quality.

DISLIKES:

Some Slow Moments

Some Okay Excess Material

Two Characters Not Bringing the Full Magic

Some Graphics Traipse To Less Impressive

Would Have Maybe Extended Some Other Stories

Summary: For all the good of this movie, I found only a few things that I felt took away from the film. As a warning, I have not seen the shows and am not a purist of the franchise, so the accuracy checks are something I leave to other reviews to determine how close this movie hit. My first dislike was that there were still some slow moments, extensions, or additions that didn't feel necessary for the level of detail and could have maybe been redirected to another story or character that might be a better use of the new direction. I felt a little robbed of Nessa's storyline, and though my friend said it matched close enough, I just felt this was the place to add a little more oomph to her tale with how tied she was to Elphaba's tale and her father that at first seemed to be a shadow looming around her. Two characters in particular that felt a tad limited and off were The Wizard and The Madame, both having their strengths of being jovial and ominous as the trailers expected and really capturing elements of them well. Yet, the two stars didn't quite get the full spectacle down, sometimes unable to break out of their stereotypical roles and other times not quite getting the full quirkiness and suave performance that they were trying. In the grand scheme, it is minimal secondary to the rest of the entertaining spectacle. Outside of some graphic trips here and there, the only other thing is that it doesn't quite capture the full show-stopping power of the play, but that order was going to be hard to accomplish given the differences between theater and film.

The VERDICT Though Wicked's first part might not be the theatrical show to the full extent, it does a fantastic job of bringing much of it to the screen. It respects the material and keeps the energy alive with stunning visuals, powerful musical performances, and the complex energy famous for Oz's prequel. Incredible performances by the leads in singing and acting are a solid core that supports all the components of the film, adding their own twists to the character but never to the point of obliterating the established personalities of these dazzling women. With a moving pace and enchanting energy, Wicked's movie is indeed a fun film worthy of the theater and perhaps in 3-D if you want that added detail to enhance the design of the world. True, there are some excess scenes and slower moments that could have been buffed with better storylines for other characters. Some of the actors could have tightened their performances or expanded outwards to help with getting the most out of the characters. Outside of that, this movie is certainly one of the better films of the year, and I encourage all to go out and see it, especially those who love powerful performances. I can say that purists are still going to find some qualms with the film, but if you can accept some of the new changes (some of which are very welcome for more reasons than one), you might just have a good time.

My scores are:

Fantasy/Musical/Romance/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.",4,11
2,Wicked,2024/11/22,Nailed It: Go see this!!,thomasltanner,2024/11/22,10,"Every single role knocked it out of the park. I already knew Erivos was going to crush it, and I was correct. I was expecting a semi decent job from Grande, but I was wrong: she also crushed it!! The musical numbers were great, the choreography was great, the cinematography was great. And for the people saying it was too long, I did not get that at all. The pacing was perfect and I was dreading to know that part one was coming to an end. It could have kept going and I would have been content for another 2 1/2 hours. One of the downsides of this movie versus when I saw this on Broadway is I was able to see the whole show in one sitting. Now I have to wait a whole year to see the culmination of this masterpiece. We will likely see this again in a few days.",3,16
