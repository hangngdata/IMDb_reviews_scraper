Arianas powerful vocals combined with extrodinary vocal control are able to get you to tears as well as the power and pureness of Cynthia Erivos voice.

The latter two leads have great chemistry together with wonderful voices and acting. A sweeping 2.5 hour epic that justifies its two parts. Incredible costumes.
